# Coworking-Final-Project
Please download the repository and store it where you like

## Accessing the code/paper for the project
To access the paper, navigate to data > Coworking Feasibility Final Paper.

In order to access the code and reproduce the results for yourself, please navigate to data > Data.Rproj. Ensure that you have all required packages installed by reviewing and copying/pasting the code chunk at line 145. Immediately following this code chunk are the instructions to download the source data. Please follow these instructions. You are now ready to run the whole script.

Another thing you may want to know is that if this script gets run too many times, then you may run out of Google Maps calls for the day (They only allow 2,500 free calls per day). The script will crash and you will have to register your own API Key and fit it into the code, or else wait until tomorrow.

## Accessing the Slide Deck
To access the slide deck, please navigate to data > Springboard Deliverables > Coworking Presentation.pptx
